The files in this directory are:

	Makefile
	g.h - global declarations for all Prolog files
	in.h - include file for input routines
	lex.c - lexical analyzer
	main.c - obvious
	make.c - copy objects from stack on to heap
	mem.c - memory allocation routines
	monitor.c - tracing, backtrace and link to profiling
	out.c - output routines
	p_IO.c - predefined I/O predicates
	p_basic.c - predefined  predicates for arithmetic and comparisons
	p_behave.c - predefined predicates for defining operators, abort, halt
	p_clause.c - predefined predicates for making clauses
	p_streams.c - predefined predicates for manipulating streams
	p_meta.c - predefined predicates functor, univ, retract, assert, etc.
	p_unix.c - predefined predicates for accessing Unix
	parse.c - operator precedence parser
	pred.c - predefined atoms and hash table initialization
	pred.h - include for p_*.c files
	profile.c - procedures for profiling
	prove.c - the Prolog interpreter
	spaces.c - memory management routines


If you want to add your own predefined predicates, look at the p_*.c files.
These include the file 'pred.h' at the beginning. At the end, they have a
symbol table which, by convention, is the same name as the file. 'pred.c'
should contain a call to 'add_atoms' to initialize the hash table from the
table of atoms you have supplied.
