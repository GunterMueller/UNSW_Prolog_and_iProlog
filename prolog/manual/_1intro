This document describes a Prolog interpreter for
computers running under the Unix operating system.
The interpreter was written in C by Claude Sammut
at the Department of Computer Science,
University of New South Wales.
Tony Grech added streams and Unix process control and
optimised some of the older code.
Real arithmetic was added by Andrew Nicholson.
The original version of this manual was written by L.M. Pereira,
F.C.N. Pereira and D.H.D. Warren
for DECsystem-10 Prolog.
It was adapted for UNSW Prolog by Claude Sammut
with additions by Tony Grech.
