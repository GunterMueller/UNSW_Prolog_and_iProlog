X

     If X is instantiated to a term which would be acceptable  as   body  of  a
     clause,  the goal X is executed exactly as if that term appeared textually
     in place of the X.  In particular,  any   cut  ('!')  occurring  in  X  is
     interpreted as if it occurred in the body of the clause containing X. If X
     is not  instantiated  as  described the clause fails.
