The  Prolog  interpreter  provides  a  tracing  facility.   Procedures  may   be
individually  traced  enabling  each  call  the procedure to be displayed on the
terminal with the  current  values  of  its  arguments.

Tracing of procedure procedure is enabled by the command:-

                                trace procedure!

Tracing is disabled by the command:-

                               untrace procedure!

Trace and untrace may also be given lists of procedure names are arguments. Then
all the procedures in the list will be traced or untraced.

At the beginning of a line output by the trace procedure, Prolog  prints  either
of the following:


     C>
     E<
     F<
     R>


'C' indicates that a procedure is being called  for  the  first  time.   A  line
beginning  with  'E'  shows the interpreter exiting a clause after all the goals
have been satisfied.  'F' indicates an exit from a clause due to  a  failure  in
satisfying  a  goal.   After  a failure, Prolog will attempt to redo a procedure
call if there are alternative clauses left in the procedure definition.  This is
shown by an 'R'.

An example of tracing output is shown below:


     : f(A, b) :- g(A).

     : g(A) :- A = a.
     : g(c).

     : trace [f, g]!
     : f(c, b)?

     C|>f(c, b)
     C||>g(c)
     R||>g(c)
     E||<g(c)
     E|<f(c, b)
