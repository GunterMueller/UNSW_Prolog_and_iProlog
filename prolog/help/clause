clause(P,Q)

     P  must be  bound  to  a  non-variable term,  and  the  current interpreted
     program is searched for clauses whose head matches P.  The head and body of
     those clauses  are unified  with  P  and  Q respectively.   If one  of  the
     clauses is a unit clause, Q will be unified with 'true'.
