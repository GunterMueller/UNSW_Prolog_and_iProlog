To run Prolog under the Unix operating system type:

     % prolog file1 file2 ...

file1, file2, ... contain Prolog programs which are to be loaded before the user
is  asked  to  type  a  command.   If a syntax error occurs in a file, the error
message will include the name of the file and the number of the line in which it
occurred.

When the files are loaded the system responds with a prompt ':'.  The  user  may
then enter programs or type in commands.

The -s option may also be specified in the command line.  For example,

                           % prolog -s3000 file_name

This indicates that the variable stack is  to  increased  to  3000  units.   The
default  size  is 1000.  This option should only be necessary when running large
programs.
