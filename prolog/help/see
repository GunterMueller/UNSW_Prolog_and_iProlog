see(X)

	If X is an open input stream, then it is made the current input
	stream.

	If X is an atom, it is taken to be a file name and
		- if there is an input stream currently associated with a file
		  of that name then it is made the current input stream.( If
		  more than one input stream is associated with X, one is
		  chosen arbitrarily)
		- otherwise ,that file is opened, a stream created and and set
		  to be the current input stream
