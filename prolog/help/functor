functor(T,F,N)

     The principal functor of term T has name F and arity N, where  F is  either
     an   atom  or,  provided  N  is 0, an integer.  Initially, either T must be
     instantiated to a non-variable, or F and N  must  be    instantiated    to,
     respectively,  either  an   atom  and  a non-negative integer or an integer
     and 0. If these conditions are not satisfied, an error  message  is  given.
     In  the case where T is initially instantiated to a variable, the result of
     the call  is to  instantiate  T   to  the  most  general  term  having  the
     principal functor indicated.
