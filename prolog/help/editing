It is possible to  edit  procedures  and  files  within  Prolog.   To  edit  the
definition of a procedure, use the command:

                               ed ProcedureName?

The procedure will be printed onto a temporary file and the standard text editor
will  automatically be called by Prolog.  When the editor is exited, Prolog will
replace the old definition of the  procedure  with  the  edited  form.   If  the
procedure had been read in from a file, the file is not changed.

If your system has more than one  text  editor  available,  it  is  possible  to
specify  which  editor  is to be used by assigning the name of the editor in the
variable "EDITOR" in the shell environment.

Files of procedures (also called modules) may be edited using the command:

                                  em FileName!

The standard text editor will be invoked and the file may be changed.   On  exit
from  the  editor, the file will be reloaded.  Any changed made to the file will
be permanent.

Any file, whether it contains Prolog code or not may  be  edited  by  using  the
command:

                                  ef FileName!

As with em, the text editor will be invoked automatically.  However, the file is
not read by Prolog on exit from the editor.
