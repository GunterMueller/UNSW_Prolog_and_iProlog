bagof(V, P, L)

     Find all all terms, V, such that P is true.  Append  V  to  the  list,  L.
     Bagof  uses  backtracking to find all the solutions to P.  [Note: This is
     the same as Prolog-10's bagof predicate  except that  the  additional  "^"
     notation  for existentially  quantified  variables  is  not required.  All
     unbound variables in P are assumed to be existentially quantified].
