retract(C)

     The first clause in the current interpreted  program  that   matches  C  is
     erased.   C  must  be initially instantiated to a non-variable, and becomes
     unified with the value of  the  erased  clause.   The  space   occupied  by
     the  erased  clause  will  be recovered when instances of the clause are no
     longer in use.
