process(ShellCommand, Istream, Ostream)

	ShellCommand is an atom or string which is passed to a Bourne shell to
	be executed asynchronously as an ordinary Unix command.The two arguments
	refer to the input and output of the created process.

if Istream is a:
	Stream - ShellCommand takes its input from this stream
	Var    - Process creates a new stream, binds it to Istream and
		 instructs ShellCommand to use it for standard input.
		 Current_stream(ShellCommand, write, Stream) is
		 then asserted into the data base.

if Ostream is a:
	Stream - ShellCommand sends its output to this stream
	Var    - Process creates a new stream, binds it to Ostream and
		 instructs ShellCommand to use it for standard output.
		 Current_stream(ShellCommand, read, Stream) is
		 then asserted into the data base.

Note :	Either Istream or Ostream (or both) may be the anonymous variable ('_')
	if no stream is required.
