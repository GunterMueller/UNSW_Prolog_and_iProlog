backtrace or backtrace(N)

     causes the parent goals and their arguments to be displayed starting
     with the most recent goal. If an argument is supplied, this
     instructs prolog to limit the depth of this and future backtraces to N.
     This Depth currently defaults to 5. Backtrace(0) is thus a means whereby
     users may turn off the automatic backtrace generated after warnings.
