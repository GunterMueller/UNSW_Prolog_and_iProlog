An important class of data structures are the lists.    These   are  essentially
the  same  as  the  lists  of Lisp.  A list either is the atom:-

                                       []

representing the empty list, or is a compound term with  two   arguments   which
are  respectively the head and tail of the list.  Lists are entered in a special
notation.  A list of the first three natural numbers is written as:

                                   [1, 2, 3]

The special list notation in the case when the tail of  a  list  is  a  variable
is exemplified by:-

                              [X, ..L] [a, b, ..L]

For compatibility with Prolog-10, this may also be written as:

                                [X|L] [a, b | L]
