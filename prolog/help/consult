consult(F)

     Instructs the interpreter to read-in the program which is in file F.   When
     a  directive  is read it is immediately executed.  When a clause is read it
     is put after any clauses already  read   by   the  interpreter   for   that
     procedure.  When  a file has been consulted, a predicate file(F, Proc_List)
     is asserted. Proc_List is a list of the procedures defined in F.
