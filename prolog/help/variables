Variables are distinguished by an initial capital  letter  or   by  the  initial
character "_", eg.

                          X Value A   A1  _3   _RESULT

If a variable is only referred to once, it does not need to  be  named and   may
be   written  as  an  "anonymous"  variable  indicated  by  a  single  underline
character:-
                                       _

A  variable  should  be  thought  of  as   standing  for   some   definite   but
unidentified  object.    This  is   analogous to the use of a pronoun in natural
language.  Note that a variable  is  not  simply  a  writeable storage  location
as   in   most  programming  languages;  rather it is a local name for some data
object.
