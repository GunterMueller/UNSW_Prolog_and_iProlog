assert(C)

     The current instance of C is interpreted as a clause and is added  to   the
     current   interpreted  program  (with  new  private variables replacing any
     uninstantiated variables). The position of  the   new  clause   within  the
     procedure concerned is implementation-defined.  C must be instantiated to a
     non-variable.
