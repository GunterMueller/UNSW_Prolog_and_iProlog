name(X,L)

     If X is an atom, integer or real then L is a list of the characters of
     the name of X. eg.:-

                         name(product, [p, r, o, d, u, c t])

     If X is instantiated to a variable, L must be instantiated  to  a  list  of
     characters.  eg.:-

                              ? name(X, [f, r, e, d]).

     name is defined in terms of concat and char.
