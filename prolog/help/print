print(X, ...) or print(Stream,X, ...)

     print will accept a variable number of arguments, printing each term on the
     same line of the current or specified output stream. If an argument is a
     string (enclosed in '"') then the string is printed without quotes. This
     print may be  used  to  output  messages. A newline character is appended
     to the output. The  special character sequences '\n' and '\t' are
     recognized as newline and tab respectively.
