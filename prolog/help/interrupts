Execution of a program is started by   giving   the   interpreter   a  directive
which contains a call to one of the program's procedures.

Only when  execution  of  one  directive  is  complete   does   the  interpreter
become   ready   for   another  directive. However, one may interrupt the normal
execution of a directive by typing <delete> This <delete>  interruption  has the
effect   of  terminating  the  execution  of  the command.  The system will then
respond with a prompt.

Execution may also be terminated if the program runs out of stack  space.   When
this  occurs,  the  user  may save the current program and reexecute Prolog with
more stack space by using the -s option in the shell command.
Warning: make sure that the reason the program ran out of stack  space  was  not
due to an error in the program before increasing the size of Prolog.
