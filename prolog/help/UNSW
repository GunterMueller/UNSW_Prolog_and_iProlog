This document describes a Prolog interpreter for  VAX-11  and  PDP-11  computers
running under the Unix operating system.  The original version of the manual was
written by L.M. Pereira, F.C.N.  Pereira  and  D.H.D.  Warren  for  DECsystem-10
Prolog.   It has been adapted for UNSW Prolog by Claude Sammut.  The interpreter
was written in C by Claude Sammut while in the Department of  Computer  Science,
University  of  New  South  Wales.  He was assisted by Shaun Arundell (UNSW) and
later modifications were suggested  by  Alan  Feuer,  Bell  Labs,  Murray  Hill.
Wherever  possible we have tried to make this system compatible with the Prolog-
10, however, there are significant differences and it should  not  assumed  that
programs can be ported without some changes.
