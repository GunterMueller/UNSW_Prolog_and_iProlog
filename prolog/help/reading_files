A  program  is  made  up  of  a sequence   of   clauses,  possibly  interspersed
with  directives  to  the interpreter. The clauses of a procedure do not have to
be immediately consecutive, but remember that their  relative   order   may   be
important.  The  text  of a program is normally created separately in a file (or
files), using the text editor.

To input a program from a file file inside Prolog, give the command:-

                                   load file!

which will instruct the interpreter to read-in the  program.  If  the file  name
contains  characters  such as '.', its name is "prog.pl" say, it is necessary to
give the complete filename between quotes.

Any characters following the '%' character on any line are treated as part of  a
comment and are ignored.

When a file is loaded, a predicate of the form

                         file(FileName, ProcedureList)

is becomes true.  FileName is the name of the loaded file and ProcedureList is a
list  of the names of the procedures defined in the file.  When the same file is
loaded a second time, the definitions of the  procedures  in  ProcedureList  are
first removed so that clauses in the procedures are not duplicated.

Clauses may also be typed in directly  at  the  terminal,   (although  this   is
only   recommended  if  the  clauses  will  not  be  needed permanently, and are
few in number).
