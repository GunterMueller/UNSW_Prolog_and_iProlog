ed P

     A listing of procedure P is output to a temporary file.  The text editor is
     the  called to allow the user to change the definition.  When the editor is
     terminated, the file is read in causing the procedure to be redefined if no
     syntax errors were found.  If the interpreter discovered syntax errors, the
     user is asked if the procedure is to be re-edited.  If the response is 'n',
     the old definition is restored.  Any other response causes the editor to be
     invoked again.
