op(priority, type, name)

     Treat name as an operator of the stated  type  and priority.  name may
     also be a list of names in which case all are to be treated as operators of
     the  stated  type  and priority.

     If Name is already an operator or list of operators, Priority and Type
     are successively bound to the priority and type of Name.

	for eg.

		: op(600, xfx, if)!		% define infix operator

		: op(P, T, infix if)?

		P = 600
		T = xfx
