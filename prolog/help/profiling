profiling

	once this predicate is called profiling is enabled. If profiling is
	already on, each clause is reinitiallised.


profile or profile(F)

	Profiling information gathered after a call to profiling, is displayed.
	Without an argument all user defined clauses are shown. With an
	argument, only the clauses associated with file F are given. The
	latter call is often more convenient because it preserves the clause
	ordering supplied by the user whereas the former does not.


profile1(A)

	Shows profiling information for all the interpreted clauses for
	predicates with name A, where A is bound to an atom.


	each clause is displayed in the following form :

	calls fails exits	cputime (seconds)
	a :-
		exits	a1,
		  "	a2,
		  "	.
		  "	.
		  "	an.

	The fail parameter is incremented every time a clause is called and
	does not exit. Note that the sum of fails and exits may not equal
	calls, because a clause may exit more than once due to backtracking.

	If a clause is never called, only its head is shown, marked by an
	asterix.
