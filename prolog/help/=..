X =.. Y

     Y is a list whose head is the atom corresponding to the  principal  functor
     of X and whose tail is the argument list of that functor in X. eg.:-

                   product(0, N, N - 1) =.. [product, 0, N, N - 1]

     If X is instantiated to a variable, then Y  must  be   instantiated  to   a
     list  of determinate length whose head is atomic (ie.  an atom or integer).
