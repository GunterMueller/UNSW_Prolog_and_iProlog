The constants include integers such as:-

                                0 1   999   -512

In UNSW Prolog, integers are restricted to the range -2^31  to 2^31-1 on the VAX
and -2^15 to 2^15-1 on the PDP-11.

Constants include reals such as:-

		    0.0   1.0   34.45  -23.45  3.45e-02

In  prolog, reals have the same range as float in C. Printing reals will only
give 4 decimal place accuracy.

Constants also include atoms such as:-

                        a void   =   := 'Algol-68'   []

The symbol for an atom can be  any  sequence  of  characters,  which  should  be
written  in quotes if there is possibility of confusion with other symbols (such
as variables, integers). As in conventional  programming  languages,   constants
are  definite  elementary  objects,  and  correspond  to proper nouns in natural
language.
