P ->  | R or P -> ; R

     Analogous to

                                 "if P then  else R"

     i.e. defined as if by

     P -> Q | R :- P, !, Q.
     P -> Q | R :- R.


P -> Q

     When occurring other than as one of the alternatives of a  disjunction,  is
     equivalent to:

     P ->  | fail.
