read(X) or read(Stream, X)

     The next term, delimited by a "fullstop" (ie.  a '.' followed  by <cr>   or
     a  space), is read from the current or given input stream and unified with 
     X. The syntax of the term must accord with current operator declarations.
     If a call 'read(X)' causes the end of the stream to be reached, X
     is unified  with   the   term  "end_of_file".   If  input  comes  from  the
     terminal, the user is prompted by "> ".
