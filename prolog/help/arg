arg(I,T,X)

     Initially, I must be instantiated  to  a  positive  integer  and  T   to  a
     compound  term.  The result of the call is to unify X with the Ith argument
     of term  T.  (The  arguments  are   numbered   from   1  upwards.)  If  the
     initial  conditions are not satisfied or I is out of range, the call merely
     fails.
