cylinder ako object with

	height:
		range		number(new value) and new value > 0
		help		print("Height must be a positive number")
		if_needed	ask
		if_removed	remove volume from this cylinder
		cache		yes;
	radius:
		range		number(new value) and new value > 0
		help		print("Radius must be a positive number")
		if_needed	ask
		if_removed	remove cross_section from this cylinder
		cache		yes;
	cross_section:
		if_needed	pi * radius of this cylinder ** 2
		if_removed	remove volume from this cylinder
		cache		yes;
	volume:
		if_needed	cross_section of this cylinder * height of this cylinder
		cache		yes!


c isa cylinder with height: 2; radius: 4!
d isa cylinder with colour: red!
