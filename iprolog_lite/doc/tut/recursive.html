<h2>
RECURSIVE PROGRAMS</h2>
In the library database example we saw how terms in Prolog can be used
to represent objects such as books, library members, loans records, <i>etc</i>.
Some complex terms contained other terms, for example, <tt>book</tt> contained
<tt>name</tt>. The following term also contains another term , this time
it is one similar to itself:
<pre>&nbsp;tree(tree(_, jack, _), jim, tree(_, jill, _))</pre>

<dl>
<dt>
The '_' symbol may be replaced by any other term, we don't care what it
is. A structure like this could be used to represent a binary tree that
looks like:</dt>
</dl>

<p>A term which contains another term which has the same principal functor
is said to be <i>recursive</i>.
<p>The definition of a binary tree is that it is a structure which is either
empty or it contains a left and right subtree. A non-empty tree may also
contain some data. In Prolog we would express this definition as:
<pre>&nbsp;is_tree(empty).
&nbsp;is_tree(tree(Left, Data, Right)) :-
&nbsp;is_tree(Left),
&nbsp;some_data(Data),
&nbsp;is_tree(Right).</pre>
The empty tree is represented by the word empty. This is not some special
word known to Prolog, it is just an arbitrary word that we choose to use
by convention. A non-empty tree is represented by a 3-arity term. Two of
the arguments are the left and right sub-trees which are also binary trees.
The Data field is any data which we care to put in the tree. Now let us
define the size of tree:
<pre>&nbsp;tree_size(empty, 0).
&nbsp;tree_size(tree(Left, _, Right), Total_Size) :-
&nbsp;tree_size(Left, Left_Size),
&nbsp;tree_size(Right, Right_Size),
&nbsp;Total_Size is Left_Size + Right_Size + 1.</pre>
That is, the size of an empty tree is zero and the size of a non-empty
tree is the size of the left sub-tree plus the size of the right sub-tree
plus one for the current tree node. The data does not contribute to the
total size of the tree.
<p>Notice that when there is a recursive relationship between terms ,we
write recursive programs to describe these relationships. A recursive program
is one which refers to itself, thus, <tt>tree_size</tt> contains goals
which call <tt>tree_size</tt> recursively.
