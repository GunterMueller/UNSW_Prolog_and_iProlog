NSW Prolog and iProlog

The first version of UNSW Prolog was written in 1979 and was one of the first Prolog interpeters to be widely available. By 1985, it was in use in about 4,000 sites around the world. Prolog compilers for large scale applications are now common, so development of UNSW has ceased.

Another Prolog interpreter, iProlog, is being used for teaching and for experimental development of new Inductive Logic Programming tools. While trying to be compatible with the ISO standard, iProlog also includes eager functional evaluation, a frame representation language, ripple-down rules for expert system development and a variety of machine learning algorithms.
